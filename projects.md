Steamleft is built with Rails.

Steamleft had over 650,000 unique visitors, and 500,000 participating users in its first week. It was featured on PCGamer, Kotaku, The Escapist, and dozens of more online outlets.

Steamleft is a webapp that aggregates and compares data between your personal Steam API and HowLongToBeat's data to estimate how much time it would take to beat your entire Steam library. It also provides hilarious alternatives for what you could be doing with your time, like reading The Hobbit or running across the United States a certain number of times.

### Missionary Memoir

[visit](https://www.missionarymemoir.com/)

Missionary Memoir has a React frontend and a Node/Express.js backend.

Missionary Memoir is my biggest personal project. Its a business I started to help people print a custom hardcover book from their emails. Its mainly marketed towards missionaries who have sentimental emails from their missionary experiences that they want to keep forever in the form of a hardcover book.
