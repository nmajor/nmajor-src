Chrome has  a slightly different event loop than Node for example, but they

#### Javascript is single threaded and synchronous. The event loop makes it asynchronous (for some things)

You've probably heard of the V8 javascript engine. It is the javascript engine used by Chrome and Node. The javascript V8 engine is single threaded. The event loop manages a stack and task queue and sometimes even worker threads to make javascript behave in a non-blocking async way for certain functions.

Javascript runs on a single thread which means it can only do 1 thing at a time. So how is is asynchronous?

Anyone who has used javascript knows that some things happen synchronously one line at a time while other things are async and require callbacks.
